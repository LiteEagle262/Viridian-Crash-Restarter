# Viridian-Crash-Restarter
A restarter for viridian trade bot, if the bot crashes, or vps goes down, once it comes back on your trade bot goes on!

Most likely you dont need to edit the `"procces_name": "Cry.ConsoleApp.exe"` line as thats the default name for the bot, just there for the people who change it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
