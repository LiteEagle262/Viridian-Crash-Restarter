# Viridian-Crash-Restarter
A restarter for viridian trade bot, if the bot crashes, or vps goes down, once it comes back on your trade bot goes on!

Most likely you dont need to edit the `"procces_name": "Cry.ConsoleApp.exe"` line as thats the default name for the bot, just there for the people who change it  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**A compiled version is in releases if you dont have python and or your vps doesnt have it installed, so you dont have to go through installing it**
