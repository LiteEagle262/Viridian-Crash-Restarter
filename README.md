# Viridian-Crash-Restarter
A restarter for viridian trade bot, if the bot crashes, or vps goes down, once it comes back on your trade bot goes on! (refreshes players.txt)

**Ment mainly for vps**
**Dont re-upload please.**

**A compiled version is in releases if you dont have python and or your vps doesnt have it installed, so you dont have to go through installing it**

**SETUP:**
Put the restarter.py or restarter.exe depending on what one you downloaded in the same folder as viridian

once done, I recommend you to create a shortcut for restarter.py or restarter.exe and putting it in your windows start menu folder, what this does is every time your vps crashes the application can auto restart your bot, if you need help adding it to your start menu folder, go to the file manager, you will see a thing that looks kinda like this [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48303729/180705783-b697efc8-60ca-4b6d-ba57-77db3089fa1a.png) click to the right of everything, and copy paste this in `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs` that will bring you to the start menu folder where you can drop the shortcut into,

boom now your all setup!! just run it!!
